this got nowhere, but it was fun

mostly a fun learning project, wasn't meant to be fast or good or anything :)


i got bored with it so theres tons of debug code and my variable names are all over the place. this is a _terrible_ learning resource. but feel free to ask me whatever if you think that i could actually help you!
